A simple squash game with eye tracking. Move the paddle with your eyes to where the ball is going to make it bounce back. Get as many hits as possible on the walls and try to keep the ball inside the play area as long as possible. If you don't have Tobii Eyetracking, you can use the mouse to move. Hold left mouse click for an easter egg.

## Insights
I got a hold of Tobii Eye Tracking and decided to make a simple game with it. The purpose was to understand how it works and get an idea of how to handle it. Easiest way to make use of it was to make a "3D Pong" like game. I plan to make more app-based projects with the eye tracker.
